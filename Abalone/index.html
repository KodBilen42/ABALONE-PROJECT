                    The board consists of 61 circular spaces arranged in a hexagon, five on a side.
                    Each player has 14 marbles that rest in the spaces and are initially arranged as shown below, on the left image.
                    The players take turns with the black marbles moving first.
                    For each move, a player moves a straight line of one, two or three marbles of one color one space in one of six directions.
                    The move can be either broadside / arrow-like (parallel to the line of marbles) or in-line / in a line (serial in respect to the line of marbles),
                    as illustrated below.
                </p>

                    A player can push their opponent's marbles (a "sumito") that are in a line to their own with an in-line move only.
                    They can only push if the pushing line has more marbles than the pushed line (three can push one or two; two can push one).
                    Marbles must be pushed to an empty space (i.e. not blocked by a marble) or off the board.
                    The winner is the first player to push six of the opponent's marbles off of the edge of the board.
